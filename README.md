# Cassette Tape Collection

This program is a part of the 01219114 Computer Programming 1 course. It's also
intended to create a cassette tape collection for those of you who, like
myself, enjoy collecting cassette tapes.

## Modules

This program consists of three modules.

1. [cassette.py](cassette.py)
   This module contains the `CassetteTape` class, which is used to create each
   cassette tape data.

2. [data.py](data.py)
   This module contains the `CollectionData` class, which is used to create a
   database file as 'json' file.

3. [stage.py](stage.py)
   This module contains the `Stage` class, which is used to create all of the
   graphical output in this program.

More than three Python modules are also used in this program. The first is [`turtle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html),
which is used for the graphical part, the second is [`os`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html?highlight=os#module-os), which is used to browse a URL, 
and the third is [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html?highlight=json#module-json), which is used for data collection.

## Main Program

If you want to run this program please use [app.py](app.py).

The program includes seven menus for the user's convenience.

* Inset new tape.
* Search tape from collection.
* Delete tape from collection.
* Show all cassette tapes in collection.
* Find song from cassette tapes.
* Show all song in cassette tape.
* Open cassette tape on youtube.

**For better experience please download font `Consolas` into your computer.**

### I hope you find my work interesting :)
